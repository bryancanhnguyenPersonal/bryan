                    <p>Professional programming has grown to become extremely competitive for anyone
                        that is just entering the market. As a graduating computer science student, I have realized that it is not
                        only about just graduating and sending resumes to different companies anymore
                    </p>

                            I hear a lot of people tell me that I am lucky that I got to start working so early on and that I shouldn't have any trouble finding a job
                            after I graduate. However, I do find it hard to still land a solid job. When I first started programming as a
                            QA Engineer, I thought I was on top of the world because I was getting my hands dirty in programming. I came to
                            realize that I was barely scraping the top of the technology spectrum. There are so many powerful technologies
                            out there that it's hard to keep up. I felt so comfortable being where I was that I ignored all the opportunities
                            to learn new tools. When I finally decided that I would become a developer, I had to open myself to all the latest tools
                            and swallow in the fact that I would have to keep building myself for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But it wasn't just about
                            learning everything because that is literally impossible. I had to find where I fit in development. Many of my
                            colleagues just apply to any type of job regardless of what the description says because they don't know where
                            they fit in development quite yet. I believe that it is important that any junior developer finds out where they belong
                            as soon as they get some relative experience, because sometimes switching to a different position in development is hard when
                            you already have a couple years doing what you've been doing for a while. So what I learned from all this was to keep
                            building myself and to never stop hacking.
