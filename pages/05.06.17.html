                           full time job, I've totally started neglecting this website and updating what is going on in my career. I will be starting
                           full time for Ellie Mae as a Software Developer focused mainly on Angular. I'll be spending most of my time expanding my knowledge
                           so there won't be a post here for a long time as well. I hope by the time I can call myself a Senior Developer that I will come 
                           back to this site to update more and share what I have learned.
