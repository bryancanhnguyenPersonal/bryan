                    <p>Switching from a typed language to a not so typed language
                      had to be one of the hardest things to take in at first.
                      After being trained so hardcore in Java and writing Selenium scripts for days on end, it was hard learning a language that not only had no typing.
                      In fact, I was so scared of learning this language
                      only because I was stuck in a the safe developer's bubble

                            I should be more specific about this bubble. This bubble is the fear of thinking that learning one programming language will have you set for life. At the time, I kept wanting to think about what would be the best I could do with Java. Java actually made
                            me dread programming only because a lot of what I had learn was out of date. It took me a long time before I was able to step out and learn other languages such as some C++ and Python. However, none of these languages gave
                            me really interested me. Eventually, I came across a great tutorial on how to make a website on Udemy. Udemy is an amazing site for learning all sorts of things related to programming, business, and even music!

                            I purchased this tutorial by Jonas Schmedtmann and by the 3rd video (skipping all the setting up), I found myself coding for 5 hours straight trying to get a simple single page application working. His tutorials didn't go too much into JavaScript itself,
                            but more on the HTML, CSS, and some PHP. This introduction into web development was just enough for me to create my own website and be completely hooked. Web Development is an amazing environment to be in because as soon as
                            you code it, you can see it in the browser. No other languages gave me this kind of response. Soon enough, I had to learn JavaScript to make my pages more dynamic. Many bridges had to be crossed, but I don't regret a single
                            moment for switching to JavaScript.
