                    <p>        Hello! My name is <span style="color:#2c3e50; font-weight:bold;">Bryan Nguyen</span>. I am currently a graduating Computer Science student at <span style="color: #eebf3d; font-weight:bold;">San Jose State University</span>. My web programming career started as early as the days of MySpace were still around. I first began fiddling with Myspace themes that I would create for friends. I never really took web programming seriously as it was much like a toy for me at the time. I came into <span style="color: #eebf3d; font-weight:bold;">San Jose State University</span>. as a Computer Engineering major, however, I found out quickly that I wasn't too much into the hardware side of the curriculum. I decided to switch to Computer Science and focus on purely programming.

        Going into my second year of college, I started working as a QA Intern at <span style="color:#0067ac; font-weight:bold;">Ellie</span> <span style="color:#939598; font-weight:bold;">Mae</span>. <span style="color:#0067ac; font-weight:bold;">Ellie</span> <span style="color:#939598; font-weight:bold;">Mae</span> is a mortgage software company that specialized in automating the loan process. I wrote tons of test cases, with both being manual and automated testing focused on the mobile web browser. After 2 years as a QA Engineer, I decided that QA didn't make me obsessed with programming.

        I left <span style="color:#0067ac; font-weight:bold;">Ellie</span> <span style="color:#939598; font-weight:bold;">Mae</span> for a year to focus on school, only to return to Ellie Mae a few months later to become a web developer. Having some experience in HTML and CSS, I helped create a CMS for Ellie Mae. I picked up AngularJS experience along the way and a ton of <span style="color: #f0da50; font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> and since then I've been hooked on <span style="color: #f0da50; font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span>. My passion for <span style="color: #f0da50; font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> has convinced me that I want to be a web developer as a career and my goals are to continue doing as much as I can. I'm using this site to document my experiences, frustrations, and hopefully contributions to the community. Thanks for reading about my journey.
